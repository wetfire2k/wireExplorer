# wireExplorer
”WireExplorer” is a tool able to simulate the propagation of solitonic pulses on different types of circuits composed of one or more wires, even in the case of intersections. 
Such conditions are not canonically solvable by resolution of the KdV equations, while approximate numerical resolution allowed the evaluation of these intricate cases. 
In particular, the obtained results showed the subdivision of the wave into smaller components, at intersections between wires, which propagate in different directions 
showing also the formation of dispersive tails propagating in the direction opposite to that of the main wave.
